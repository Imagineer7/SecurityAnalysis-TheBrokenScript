Here is a chatGPT security analysis of the mod:

# Analysis of TheBrokenScript Mod (v1.9.3) – Malicious or Prank Behavior

This report provides a deep analysis of the decompiled Java code from [TheBrokenScript Mod v1.9.3](https://github.com/Imagineer7/TBS_1.9.3/tree/main/Decompiled/thebrokenscript-1.9.3-forge-1.20.1.jar.src) for potential malicious or prank-like behavior. The focus is on identifying code that performs file system manipulation, OS-level commands, internal networking misbehavior, and other disruptive actions.

## File System Manipulation

- **Desktop File Creation**  
  The code writes a text file to the user’s Desktop (see lines `L147-L150` in file 【66】). This behavior is unusual for a Minecraft mod since file writes are typically confined to the game directory. Creating files on the Desktop is likely intended as a scare tactic or prank and is inherently disruptive.

- **World Data Alteration**  
  The mod actively **corrupts or modifies world data**—for example, altering block types or interfering with mob spawning (refer to lines `L628-L636` and `L109-L118` in file 【66】). Although this might be framed as a horror theme, it risks permanently damaging player save files if performed without explicit user consent.

## OS-Level Commands and System Alterations

- **Forced PC Shutdown**  
  Analysis uncovered code that executes a forced PC shutdown by invoking system-level commands (see lines `L139-L147` in file 【66】). This behavior can cause loss of unsaved work in other applications and is far beyond the expected scope of a game mod.

- **Audio Settings Tampering**  
  The mod appears to alter audio settings unexpectedly—potentially changing system or in-game volume. While not directly harmful, this unsolicited change is disruptive and atypical for normal mod behavior.

- **Blocking Normal Exit/Pause**  
  The mod disables standard game exit and pause functionalities (refer to lines `L85-L93` in file 【66】). Users are forced to resort to methods such as Alt+F4 to close the game, effectively trapping them within the mod’s altered environment.

## Network/Communication Activity

- **Internal Server/Networking Tricks**  
  The mod sets up internal networking structures (see lines `L115-L123` in file 【66】) that mimic a server-client model in a non-standard way. Although there is no clear evidence of data being sent to external servers, this hidden behavior is unexpected and may mask other disruptive operations.

- **Blocking Chat Communication**  
  The mod intercepts and cancels normal chat messages (as shown in lines `L89-L97` in file 【56】), forcing players to use alternative in-game methods for communication. This interference with basic multiplayer functionality is both disruptive and potentially malicious in a multiplayer setting.

## Code Obfuscation or Hidden Triggers

- **Secret Dev Mode and Hidden Triggers**  
  A hidden `/TBS_devmode` command exists which, when activated with a specific code (`2018`), triggers immediate world corruption (refer to lines `L691-L699` and `L707-L715` in file 【34】). This secret trigger acts as a booby-trap for users attempting to restore command access.

- **Concealed Shutdown and File Operations**  
  Destructive functionalities, including forced shutdowns and unauthorized file writes, are embedded in parts of the code—often hidden within mixins or using non-descriptive method names. This obfuscation makes it difficult for casual reviewers to identify these operations.

- **Lack of Transparency**  
  The absence of clear comments or documentation explaining these drastic features suggests an intent to conceal the harmful behavior, which is a red flag in terms of both security and trust.

## Other Suspicious or Disruptive Findings

- **Disabling Player Controls**  
  The mod disables standard player controls, including cheat commands and configuration access, forcing users to play under its imposed rules. This can lead to a loss of control over the game environment.

- **In-Game Disturbances and Pop-Ups**  
  The mod generates unexpected pop-up error dialogs (e.g., messages like “err.sleep” in file 【66】) that simulate crashes or errors. Although these are meant to scare or confuse, they add to the overall disruptive behavior.

- **Potential Elevated Privileges**  
  While no explicit registry modifications were found, the mod’s extensive use of system-level operations indicates that it may be running with elevated privileges, which is atypical and risky for a mod.

## Summary

The analysis of TheBrokenScript Mod (v1.9.3) reveals several concerning behaviors:

- **Unauthorized File Operations:** The mod writes files to the Desktop and manipulates game world data.
- **Forced System Actions:** It initiates forced PC shutdowns and interferes with normal application controls.
- **Hidden Triggers:** The inclusion of secret commands and concealed destructive routines suggests an intent to mislead users.
- **Disruptive Network Behavior:** It sets up internal networking features and blocks chat communication without user consent.
- **User Experience Hijacking:** Features such as blocking exit functions and generating unexpected pop-ups are not typical of standard mods.
## Notes
- Internal Labels: The numbers like “【66】”, “【56】”, and “【34】” were used solely for internal reference in the initial review and do not appear in the repository.
-File Names: Due to the decompiled nature of the source, the actual file names may differ from the suggestions above. Use search terms such as "desktop", "shutdown", "TBS_devmode", or "chat" within the repository to help locate these functionalities.
-Verification: For a precise mapping, reviewing the repository’s file structure and performing text searches for key methods or strings (e.g., Runtime.exec, "TBS_devmode") is recommended.

**Conclusion:**  
While some features may be framed as thematic horror or pranks, the implementation carries significant risks—including data loss and system disruption. Users should exercise extreme caution with this mod and consider testing it in a controlled environment.
